The goal of this project (referred to by the codename "Lucid") was to graph energy usage in real time for buildings on Bloomsburg University's lower campus,
and to provide a dashboard for administrators to generate graphs or modify settings.

The site is currently live <a href="http://cswebserver.bloomu.edu:8080/Lucid/">here</a> and one of our widgets is posted on the University's <a href="http://bloomu.edu/today"><i>Today</i> page</a>.

Most of the source files for this project are included, but some configuration and build files have been removed.
